- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, you can call me @dduodd
- I recently graduated from CPP with honors
- This is my alt github account to show my (hopefully) polished projects
- My other github account is such a mess after all (lol)
- I won't be as active on this account since it is an alt

- ðŸ“« Anyways, you can reach me from my email - dz115471@gmail.com (please include that you came from github, else, I might ignore you)

<!---
dduodd/dduodd is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
